CHAPTER ONE 
1.1	INTRODUCTION
Employees are back bone of any company management of employees are performance plays a major role in decided the success of the organization in Jinka University currently have problem of management employee performance the current system is running in manual on paper the employer use cabinet to store employees record and stock useful data is scattered all over place in this chapter we shall discuss the solution to the problem being caused by current system we shall try to understand manager’s  expectations of the new system  we are to develop for him

1.2 BACKGROUND OF STUDY 
Employees are back bone of any company there for their management play a major role in deciding the success of organization human resource management software makes it easy   for the employer to keep the track all records the ever changing trend of technology in the technology brought necessity for automation everything from paper and pen to absolute computer domination the overwhelming emergency of computer paved the way easy access to information that leads to increase production ,efficiency and reliability Large and even small and medium sized companies   have always implemented a system Whether electronically or manual  to be able to manage its employees effectively the effective management of this records ensure sound decisions based on full ,accurate and up to date information to be made this also ensure that any decision made can be traced ,scrutinized and justified if necessary the human resource segment have long used such information to trace employee’s performance ,incentives ,problems etc. ,    to streamline  the companies input and consequently ,maximize its productivity this need paved the  development  of database to store and retrieve  important information in the development of generic management system ,the storage of data is prioritized .Atypical database  management system controls the creation and maintenance and uses of database storage of structure of institution a flexible and easy to use employee’s management software development solution for small and medium sized company provides module of personal information management which allow organization and company to manage the most crucial organization asset people is the combination of this modules into one application assures the perfect platform for re-engineering and aligning human resource process along with organization goals  ,as jinka university is medium sized organization it had batter to use human resource management software    

1.2 Statement of the Problem     
Currently jinka university human resource have no system which helps them to manage their employees they store employee’s information manual by using hard copy and their attendance system is backward system, they take attendance manual on hard copy this make the organization employer to handle hug load and the information also may disappear if the hard copy lost in case and also it is too boring to get specific information about one user at instant of time and if they want to get new employer they advert on public media like etv by paying a lot of money and when they get employ the employer have to come to compound to take exam even he not chosen to employment after exam result to solve this problem we create the platform which help the them to solve all those problems      
1.3 Objective
1.3.1 General objective 
 To design employee’s management system for jinka university
In order to change manual system of employee management system to computerized 
To manage employee easily and effectively using computerized way of management system   

1.3.2 Specific objective  
 > Develop well designed database to store employee’s information
> A user friendly front end for user to interact with the system
> Easy retrieval of employee’s information 
> Ability to sort employee query by department
> remove details of no longer working in organization 
> To develop online attendance system for employees 
> To register new employee easy manner
> To manage task of employee in efficient way 
> To attend employee absent or percent
> To delete information of employee who live the job 
> To retrieve and search employee information easily
> To new system is secured system that is only accessed by authorized user  


1.4 Methodology 
To get requirement we get information by using different way 
Observation 
	 We arrive to the department and observed how the workers are caring out their work activities in natural  setting observation allows us to collect data real time where activity being performed
Interview
	We make interview of jinka university human resource office
	We also gathered necessary  information about Ems and background of ems their working activity and the function of their existing system using same structured (when did university established, how does the existing system function ,how many employee are there ) and unstructured interview  
Document analysis
	We also collects certain relevant information from written document in the department not only that we also tried to review other relevant document to develop our project 
Requirement modeling (Structured vs object oriented)
Many different attempts have been made out over the last three decades to tackle the problems in software engineering that directly or indirectly lead to the symptoms of software crisis. These attempts have mostly focused on different specific fields, such as improved programming languages, improved modeling techniques, introduction of analysis and design methods, formal specifications, CASE tools, etc. In spite of the various attempts to develop high quality software systems, a difficult task still remains to be able to provide a solution to this classical problem: how to go from the problem space (user requirements) to the solution space (design and implementation) with sound methodological guidance. This PhD thesis is developed in the context of OO-Method (an object-oriented for our project we are use OO-method for above

1.5 Feasibility
  1.5.1 Economic feasibility
   Since computerization of employ management system for jinka university the is no fee for advertisement for new employ and no need of paper to register and to manage employees and also my project have online exam system for new employees with the help of artificial intelligent so it minimize the cost of transportation  for them so it is economical feasible    
1.5.2 Technical feasibility
      The project team member have learned the programing languages that required successful completion of the project such as python, JavaScript, php, html,css,bootstrap,mysql and we also learned 
The OOSAD (object oriented system analysis and Design) that we follow to develop this project  
The team member have the required skill to develop system so that the project Sayed to be technical feasible



1.5.3 Time feasibility
When the ems computerized the time taken to count total employees in the organization, highest salary number of male and female, employer is minimized and time spent to take interview question for new employees are minimized so the project is time feasible
1.6 Project Scope and Limitation
A computerized employ management system is web based application that can be accessed from anywhere with operating system for authorized user the system is central managed and controlled which is designed to run in the organization 
Our project EMS is online and we create website to check number of employee in each branch if jku will have other branch for future like employee details, salary details, attendance details etc.
The employee can submit their attendance and the manager can check the employee attendance and his task detail and apply for leave etc. and also the branch manager calculate and payout salary for his employees 
Project can be developed for online service by which employee can their detail any time any where 
Our system doesn’t include 
	 Allocating dorm to employees 
The project can be developed centralized database so that the data storage is easy 
1.6.1 Limitation
   > The shortage of written document in the university
   > Financial problem 
   > Shortage of data collecting device like sound record and digital camera
   > Shortage of finger print to create finger printing attendance system
 1.7 Significance of the project
       - Help to user significantly use their resource such as time and labor
       - To control or to monitor employee by using new technology 
       - User can easily interact with the system 
The authorized access to the information resources files of system is more advanced this means the system is developed secure login system
